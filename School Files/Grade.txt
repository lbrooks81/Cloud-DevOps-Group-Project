The grade for this will be derived from peer evaluation forms and your instructor's overall evaluation of you as a team member.

Summary from peer reviews:

Initially, there was strong engagement in the project management role, with efforts in facilitating meetings, setting up the Kanban board, and contributing to the database structure. 
However, as the project progressed, communication and task completion declined significantly, leading to the need for a change in leadership. 
Critical responsibilities, such as implementing stored procedures, data filtering, and supporting team members, were not fully met, and concerns were raised about professionalism in team interactions.
While there were challenges throughout the project, it was noted that some contributions were made in the final hours, including fixing bugs and assisting with the profile page.
The late-stage effort was appreciated by some team members, but earlier and more consistent engagement would have made a greater impact. 
Acknowledging challenges is important, but taking proactive steps to communicate and contribute consistently throughout a project is essential for both personal growth and team success.

 
Instructor comments:

I noticed that at some point during the term, your engagement with the project and school seemed to decline. 
After reading your comments about your performance, I understand how you may have been feeling. However, in a team setting, communication is key. 
If you were struggling with the leadership role, letting your team know earlier could have helped everyone adjust and support each other more effectively.
